# React Todo(s)

This repo is for practicing building CRUD todo apps with React Hooks. The `NoteApp` component is a homemade todo list app. `UltimateTodo` comes from [Code Boost's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbnmosN64JQ&feature=emb_title) tutorial.

## Usage

The ToDo app is bootstrapped from create-react-app with some modified scripts.

### Getting Started

Fork and/or clone the repo locally.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/timmybytes/react-todo.git
```

Install dependencies.

```sh
cd react-todo/
npm install
```

### Development

Start a local server for see changes live. All todo components are returned in the `App` component. Simply uncomment the one you'd like to work on/use.

```sh
npm start
```
